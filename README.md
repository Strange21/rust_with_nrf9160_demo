This repo is for someone who is trying rust on NRF9160DK
Steps to setup your development environment with NRF9160DK
NRF9160DK comes with ARM Trust Zone support, Therefore its a bit tricky to get hands dirty quickly, also the scattered information makes it more difficult for new bees with rust on NRF9160 to get started quickly.
Therefore I created this repor trying to consolidate the information as much as I can.
